The `BiocCheck` package provides a set of tools for checking a package
against the current version of Bioconductor coding and style standards.

## Installation 

To install this package, start R and enter:

```r
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("BiocCheck")
```

## Bioconductor Guidelines

The Bioconductor guidelines are available at
https://contributions.bioconductor.org/. This site provides the basis for
many of the checks performed by `BiocCheck`. We encourage packages to
follow these guidelines to ensure that they are of high quality and
interoperate well with other Bioconductor packages.

## Usage

To check a package, use the `BiocCheck::BiocCheck()` function. For
example, to check the `BiocCheck` package itself, use:

```r
BiocCheck::BiocCheck("BiocCheck")
```

in the directory above the source package directory. 

Note that the `BiocCheck` package must be installed to use this function.

If you are using RStudio, you can use the `BiocCheck` addin to check a
package. First, install the BiocAddins package:

```r
BiocManager::install("Bioconductor/BiocAddins")
```

Then, in RStudio, click on the "Addins" menu, and select "Run BiocCheck".

## Documentation

The `BiocCheck` package contains a vignette that describes the package
in more detail. To view the vignette, start R and enter:

```r
vignette("BiocCheck")
```
